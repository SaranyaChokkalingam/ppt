*To-Be Process Flow:
Input Codebase*
Contains Autosys JIL files
JIL jobs reference Shell Scripts
Shell scripts invoke COBOL Programs
*Parser Component*
Parses JIL, Shell, and COBOL files
Extracts metadata, dependencies, flow, and logic
*Context Builder*(Preprocessing Layer)
Builds structured data from parsed components
Creates interconnected context (job–script–COBOL linkages)
*RAG-Based Application (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)*
Uses LLM with custom vector store for knowledge retrieval
Queries processed data for insights like:
What a job does
Its upstream/downstream dependencies
Business logic in COBOL
*Knowledge Base + Query Layer*
End-users can query the system for code understanding
Supports semantic search, job lineage, purpose tracing






Refactored Problem Statement
Problem Statement:
Understanding and documenting legacy code—especially complex business logic in COBOL, Java, and Unix—is time-consuming and error-prone. Developers often overlook critical logic, resulting in poor documentation and limited knowledge transfer. This leads to outdated or inconsistent documentation and increases the risk of skipping essential documentation steps.

Goals:

Develop an automated tool to analyze COBOL, Java, and Unix code, extract business logic, and generate clear documentation.
Ensure documentation is continuously updated in real-time with code changes.
Simplify legacy code understanding and reduce the learning curve for developers.
Improve knowledge sharing across the team.
Challenges:

High complexity and diversity in business logic across COBOL, Java, and Unix codebases.
Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of extracted logic.
Minimizing manual errors and streamlining the workflow.
Seamless integration with existing development processes.

## **Automated Legacy Code Documentation Solution**

### **Refined Problem Statement**

Understanding and documenting legacy systems — particularly those involving complex business logic in **COBOL, Java, and Unix** — is time-consuming, error-prone, and often neglected. Critical business rules may be missed if documentation is outdated or incomplete, leading to **poor knowledge transfer**, **onboarding delays**, and **increased project risk**. Manual documentation is often skipped due to time constraints, further exacerbating inconsistency and reducing team efficiency.

### **Proposed Solution**

We propose an **automated documentation generation tool** that extracts business logic from legacy codebases (COBOL, Java, Unix) and produces **real-time, comprehensive, and human-readable documentation**. This solution addresses the "black box" nature of legacy systems and enhances visibility into core application logic for developers, testers, and business analysts.

### **Key Goals**

1. **Automate analysis** of COBOL, Java, and Unix code to extract business logic and workflows.
2. **Generate accurate, up-to-date documentation** aligned with the source code in real-time.
3. **Reduce time and effort** required for onboarding, analysis, and legacy modernization.
4. **Promote consistency and collaboration** among developers, testers, and business users.

### **Challenges Addressed**

* Complexity and variability in legacy business logic.
* Lack of alignment between documentation and actual code behavior.
* Manual documentation errors and delays.
* Integration of new tools into existing enterprise SDLC pipelines.

### **Benefits to SDLC and Modernization**

* **Faster requirement gathering** and domain understanding.
* **Streamlined onboarding** for new developers and analysts.
* Easier migration to **modern technologies** by exposing core business rules.
* Supports **testing, auditing, support, and compliance** through clear documentation.
* Reduces time and cost spent on **manual documentation and rework**.

### **Outcome**

By automating the documentation process, the solution improves efficiency, enhances accuracy, and enables teams to focus on innovation rather than reverse-engineering legacy code.

Title	CodeInsight			
Tab	Code Analysis			Document Download
Each tab Content	Tree Structure(with search which will display separate folders for : autosys, unix, java, cobol). When autosys is clicked, its corresponding unix, java/cobol files will be loaded	Code -- For unix steps, For java methods , For Cobol perform statement	Its detailed analysis , including summary to be displayed 	Display only Autosys job in tree structure and when clicked, download the full autosys, unix, java/cobol into a word document
		There should be a tree structure(with search) and when each method/step is clicked , its detailed analysis should be displayed 		Also, download option file wise
	so, if process_data.jil is clicked, only the dependent unix, cobol/java files should be loaded. Ideally only autosys folder will contain all the jil files. Remaining folders will be loaded as per dependency 			


Would you like me to generate a slide deck, executive summary, or visual diagram to go with this?
