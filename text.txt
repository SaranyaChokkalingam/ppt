Refactored Problem Statement
Problem Statement:
Understanding and documenting legacy code—especially complex business logic in COBOL, Java, and Unix—is time-consuming and error-prone. Developers often overlook critical logic, resulting in poor documentation and limited knowledge transfer. This leads to outdated or inconsistent documentation and increases the risk of skipping essential documentation steps.

Goals:

Develop an automated tool to analyze COBOL, Java, and Unix code, extract business logic, and generate clear documentation.
Ensure documentation is continuously updated in real-time with code changes.
Simplify legacy code understanding and reduce the learning curve for developers.
Improve knowledge sharing across the team.
Challenges:

High complexity and diversity in business logic across COBOL, Java, and Unix codebases.
Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of extracted logic.
Minimizing manual errors and streamlining the workflow.
Seamless integration with existing development processes.

## **Automated Legacy Code Documentation Solution**

### **Refined Problem Statement**

Understanding and documenting legacy systems — particularly those involving complex business logic in **COBOL, Java, and Unix** — is time-consuming, error-prone, and often neglected. Critical business rules may be missed if documentation is outdated or incomplete, leading to **poor knowledge transfer**, **onboarding delays**, and **increased project risk**. Manual documentation is often skipped due to time constraints, further exacerbating inconsistency and reducing team efficiency.

### **Proposed Solution**

We propose an **automated documentation generation tool** that extracts business logic from legacy codebases (COBOL, Java, Unix) and produces **real-time, comprehensive, and human-readable documentation**. This solution addresses the "black box" nature of legacy systems and enhances visibility into core application logic for developers, testers, and business analysts.

### **Key Goals**

1. **Automate analysis** of COBOL, Java, and Unix code to extract business logic and workflows.
2. **Generate accurate, up-to-date documentation** aligned with the source code in real-time.
3. **Reduce time and effort** required for onboarding, analysis, and legacy modernization.
4. **Promote consistency and collaboration** among developers, testers, and business users.

### **Challenges Addressed**

* Complexity and variability in legacy business logic.
* Lack of alignment between documentation and actual code behavior.
* Manual documentation errors and delays.
* Integration of new tools into existing enterprise SDLC pipelines.

### **Benefits to SDLC and Modernization**

* **Faster requirement gathering** and domain understanding.
* **Streamlined onboarding** for new developers and analysts.
* Easier migration to **modern technologies** by exposing core business rules.
* Supports **testing, auditing, support, and compliance** through clear documentation.
* Reduces time and cost spent on **manual documentation and rework**.

### **Outcome**

By automating the documentation process, the solution improves efficiency, enhances accuracy, and enables teams to focus on innovation rather than reverse-engineering legacy code.
